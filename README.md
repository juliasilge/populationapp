## How Is the United States Population Distributed?
### A Shiny app exploring U.S. population density

After seeing this [tweet/infographic](https://twitter.com/conradhackett/status/762520577202499586) make the rounds recently, I wanted to explore in more detail just how concentrated the United States population actually is. This Shiny app explores how the U.S. population is distributed by showing where a given percentage of the population is located, in the most populous counties. The user chooses (via a slider) what percentage of the population to use as break between high and low population counties.
